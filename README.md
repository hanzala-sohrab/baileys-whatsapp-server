# baileys-whatsapp-server

Lightweight full-featured WhatsApp Web + Multi-Device API provided by [Baileys](https://github.com/adiwajshing/Baileys) and customised for my 8th semester project.

This server needs to run in conjunction with this [Rasa server](https://github.com/hanzala-sohrab/faq-bot). This server handles the WhatsApp APIs and the Rasa server handles the NLU part.

## Steps to run locally

- Install required libraries and dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
- Start the server
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
